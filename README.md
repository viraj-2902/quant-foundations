# Quant Foundations

This repository contains foundational projects bridging
physics, mathematics, and quantitative finance.

The goal is to build intuition and tools for:
- time series analysis
- stochastic processes
- numerical modeling
- financial data analysis

This repository marks my transition into quantitative finance.
